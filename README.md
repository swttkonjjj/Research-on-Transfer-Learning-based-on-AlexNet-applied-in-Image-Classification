# Research-on-Transfer-Learning-based-on-AlexNet-applied-in-Image-Classification
Transfer learning is a machine learning method which is widely used in the field
of deep learning and image classification. The idea of transfer learning is to use the knowledge
learned from one task to better solve another task. This paper discusses the application of
transfer learning in deep learning image classification, and studies the impact of different
learning methods and learning rates on the performance of the model, and then verifies the
improvement of transfer learning on the performance of the model through experiments. This
research implements image classification of transfer learning based on AlexNet, and explores
the impact of different learning rates on model performance. In the experiment, pre training
was conducted on the ImageNet dataset, and new learning and fine-tuning were performed on
the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experimental results show that transfer learning can significantly
improve the performance of the model, accelerate the convergence speed, and improve the
accuracy of image classification. When the learning rate is 0.001, the test accuracy rate of
transfer learning is 15 percentage points higher than that of new learning. With a learning rate
of 0.01, transfer learning achieved the highest test accuracy of 92.97%.
